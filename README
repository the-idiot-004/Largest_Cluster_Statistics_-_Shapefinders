boxsize = 500 Mpc/h
grid = 300

We have performed two different analysis. First we use the entire box. Second one divides the box into 8 equal and separated cubes. The result from the second type of analysis will be used to put error bar on the quantities. Apart from the error bar estimation we will use first analysis method. You will find Clus*subbox* files and Shap*subbox* files. Files which ends with subbox0 are from first analysis which used entire box. Others are for second type of analysis. 

=============================================
For the Cosmic Dawn part:
we have used TGamma= fT * 2.725*(1+z) in Kelvin as threshould. We have used fT=1,3,6 and 10 values. Outputs from SURFGEN are saved in output$fT folder.

We have considered regions with gas temperature above TGamma and called them emission/heated region. We saved those inside output_CD_overdensity_SURFGEN.zip folder
For the other type of regions, i.e., cold/absorption regions we saved the results in output_CD_underdensity_SURFGEN.zip.

=============================================
For EoR part: 
We use threshould value as 0.5.
We did the analysis for the ionized regions only. You will find those inside output_EOR_overdensity_SURFGEN.zip
