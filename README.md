# Morphological Analysis of the IGM During the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization

This project contains the code and data to reproduce the analysis and figures from the report "Morphological Analysis of the IGM During the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization Using Large Cluster Statistics."

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   `main.py`: The main script to run the entire analysis pipeline.
-   `run_all.sh`: A convenience shell script to execute `main.py`.
-   `src/`: Contains the core Python source code.
    -   `config.py`: Central configuration for file paths, simulation parameters, and analysis settings.
    -   `data_processing.py`: Scripts for pre-processing raw data, such as generating control files and subbox CSVs.
    -   `analysis.py`: Core analysis functions for shapefinders, percolation, and statistical calculations.
    -   `plotting.py`: Functions to generate all plots for the report.
    -   `utils.py`: Utility functions used across the analysis.
-   `data/`: Contains the data used in the analysis.
    -   `raw/`: Raw simulation output from `SURFGEN2`. This data is not tracked by Git.
    -   `processed/`: Processed CSV files used as direct inputs for the analysis scripts.
-   `results/`: Directory for storing output data and plots.
    -   `data/`: Output data files generated during the analysis.
    -   `plots/`: All output figures generated by the plotting scripts.
-   `docs/`: Contains the project report (`LCS_Report.pdf`).


## How to Run the Analysis

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x
-   Required Python packages:
    -   pandas
    -   numpy
    -   matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:
`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib`

### Execution

To run the entire analysis pipeline and generate all figures from the report, execute the `run_all.sh` script from the project root directory:

```bash
bash run_all.sh
```

Alternatively, you can directly run the main Python script:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The script will:
1.  Process the raw data to create necessary control files.
2.  Run all statistical analyses.
3.  Generate all plots and save them in the `results/plots/` directory.

The final output figures are those referenced in `docs/LCS_Report.pdf`.
